PlexNMTHelper
=============

A companion/helper application to enable PLEX remote control of a Networked Media Tank (200-series or later)

PlexNMTHelper is a Java application that you can run anywhere on your home network (I run it on my PLEX Server) that enables remote control of a Networed Media Tank (NMT).

It can be controlled using
  Plex Home Theater
  Plex Mobile
  Plex/Web
